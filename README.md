I have a deep desire to be the type of person who journals often. [jrnl](https://jrnl.sh/) already exists (written in Python) but I wanted my own use cases and a few more tricks that I could spin off into other projects.


### Running the code
1. Download/clone from github

2. In your terminal run `npm link`, this connects the Node project to any changes you may want to make

3. Run it by calling `baa some example entry`, I chose `baa` because goats seem to have a handle on life

### TODO

- Make a website where I can drag & drop my text file and visualize my entries
- Add sorting
